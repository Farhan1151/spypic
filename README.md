6)install receiver's app on another device 
7)put ip address of target device.

9)take photo and the photo will be taken from the target device 
10) I have also made option on sharing picture when the device is online without same wifi network's support but it needs your own gmail account with app password.Suppose you send mail to your gmail= "1" .The forwarder App will automatically send mail with merged picture to your gmail account.
